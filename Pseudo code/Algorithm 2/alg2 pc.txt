1. Calculate sum of marks 'sumOfMarks'
2. Calculate mean by dividing sum by number of marks: mean = sumOfMarks/30.
3. Calculate sum of squared differences from mean 'sumOfSquaredDifferences' and divide by number of marks to get variance 'variance'.
4. Calculate standard deviation 'standardDeviation' by square rooting variance.
5. Print mean and standard deviation.
